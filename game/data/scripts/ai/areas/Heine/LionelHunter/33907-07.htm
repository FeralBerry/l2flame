Some heroes hadn't received a reward for overcoming their limits and completing the corresponding quests. So we've decided to support them and have prepared good equipment.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Adventurers who completed all the main quests for overcoming their limits</font> are eligible for our support. We also help <font color="LEVEL">those who completed those quests but didn't received a reward for them</font>.<br>
You can get the reward only once.<br>
